# Burgess’ Note Collections

This is my personal note collection, including some piecemeal notes or code that not enough to write a blog. The note’s document format I am using includes:

- org-mode
- Markdown
- ~~Jupyter Notebook~~

I have given up use _Jypyter Notebook_, because it not Emacs friendly. :(

## Recommend

Use Emacs [Deft](http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/) package get more friendly note tree view.
